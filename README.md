# World_Economics_Analysis

# Introduction:
The purpose of this report is to analyze a dataset containing city and country data to gain insights into various aspects of urbanization, demographics, and socio-economic factors. The dataset encompasses information such as urban population, fertility rates, life expectancy, income groups, unemployment rates, inflation rates, population sizes, and investment patterns.

The dataset provides a comprehensive snapshot of cities and countries worldwide, enabling us to explore and compare different regions and their characteristics. By leveraging the dataset, we can uncover trends, identify outliers, and draw meaningful conclusions about the state of urban areas and their corresponding countries.

# Dataset: 
The dataset comprises several tables, including "cities," "economies," and "populations." The "cities" table contains information about city names, country codes, urban populations, and city-specific demographics. The "economies" table provides details on economic indicators, such as GDP per capita, income groups, unemployment rates, and investment patterns. The "populations" table contains data on population sizes, fertility rates, life expectancies, and inflation rates.

# Analysis:
By utilizing these SQL functions, the queries in this project enable us to explore different aspects of the data and derive meaningful information. The combination of selecting specific columns, joining tables, eliminating duplicates, and performing calculations facilitates a comprehensive analysis of the city and country data.

Through the execution of these queries, we gain insights into various topics, such as urban population, fertility rate, life expectancy, unemployment rate, inflation rate, fertility rate change, income groups, population size, and total investment. The utilization of SQL functions empowers us to navigate the database efficiently and retrieve the necessary data for analysis.
